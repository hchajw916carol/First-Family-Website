    <h2>The Park's</h2>
    <p>CRYSTAL-CLEAR water flowing in a torrent, the gentle rustling of leaves in the wind, a cloudless sky overhead, the sunlight filtering through the trees. These are the delightful sights and sounds that greet us, and we are sure they are only the prelude to a magnificent day. Where are we? In the Écrins National Park, in the Dauphiné Alps, France.

        At one of the park’s entrances at Ailefroide, at the edge of the forest, information panels indicate that certain activities are forbidden in the park, such as camping or lighting fires. We are invited to take any litter home with us, and we notice that dogs are forbidden, as they often frighten or disturb the indigenous fauna.<br>

Even though we had been far away in distance, no doubt our bond as a family has been strong that kept us all united.
